  <h3>The application developed is called Move.it🏃🏼.</h3>
  The idea is based on a method called Pomodoro. Therefore, it combines technique with exercises / stretches during a short cycle of studies / work. At the end of the cycle, the user is notified and challenged to complete a certain physical exercise and, as a reward, will gain XP and level up.
